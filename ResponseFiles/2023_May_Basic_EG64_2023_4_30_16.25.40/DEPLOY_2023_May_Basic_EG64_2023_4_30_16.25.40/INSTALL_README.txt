Do NOT extract the contents of any downloaded <hot_fix_id>.zip files!

The hot fixes will be applied using the SAS Deployment Manager and should not be unzipped in advance.
By default, the SAS Deployment Manager will search in the <SASHOME>\InstallMisc\HotFixes\New directory 
for hot fixes to be applied.

You can copy the downloaded hot fixes to that directory, or, when prompted by the SAS Deployment Manager, 
you can enter the path to the directory where the hot fixes were originally downloaded (the directory that
contains the README file you are viewing now).

See the SASHFADD Usage Guide for more information:
/SASHFADD_usage.pdf

Prior to downloading and installing hot fixes, it is extremely important that you review the generated
"SAS_Hot_Fix_Analysis_Report".  Pay close attention to hot fixes with a 
[ D ] next to the "Documentation" link and follow all pre/post installation instructions contained
in the documentation.
